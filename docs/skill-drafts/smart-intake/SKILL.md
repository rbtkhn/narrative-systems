# Smart Intake

**Canonical activation:** say **`smart-intake`** or **`intake`**.

Smart intake is the canonical front door for source landing. It combines
best-intake’s archive/provenance rules with routine classification and
preflight. The implementation engine remains `scripts/land_best_intake.py`,
invoked through `scripts/smart_intake.py`.

## Core law

Read this stack in order:

`archive -> voices / channels -> work/daily`

Intake begins in `archive/`; it does not begin in synthesis or public surfaces.

## Required behavior

1. Confirm the body is materially real.
2. Classify source shape: transcript, interview, solo, newsletter, essay, or
   article.
3. Resolve the strongest available publication date and record uncertainty.
4. Resolve canonical voice and host routing; never invent a voice lane.
5. Preflight duplicate URL/path and incomplete-existing-capture conditions.
6. Land a real `archive/sources/YYYY-MM-DD/source-*.md` object.
7. Preserve the supplied body with minimal rewriting.
8. Apply only approved deterministic trim, ASR repair, and sectioning, in that
   order.
9. Append/normalize manifest and voice-index routing.
10. Verify the source, URL, metadata, manifest row, and index route.

The minimum adequate land has a real archive file, truthful title/date, source
URL or explicit unavailable status, provisional voice routing, host routing
when clear, and a manifest row.

## Routine command

```powershell
python scripts/smart_intake.py --date YYYY-MM-DD --url URL --body-file PATH --dry-run
python scripts/smart_intake.py --date YYYY-MM-DD --url URL --body-file PATH
```

Use explicit overrides when inference is ambiguous:

```powershell
python scripts/smart_intake.py --pub-date YYYY-MM-DD --ingest-date YYYY-MM-DD \
  --url URL --body-file PATH --voice-slug SLUG --host-slug HOST \
  --source-form interview --dry-run
```

The wrapper delegates publication to the best-intake engine, so its rollback
and archive-integrity behavior remains authoritative.

## Safety and boundaries

- Do not synthesize, verify claims, or publish a daily brief during intake.
- Do not auto-trim judgment-dependent material.
- Treat operator-pasted text as unverified unless explicitly verified.
- If a matching URL already exists, inspect it for completeness before making
  a repair; do not create a duplicate.
- Keep unrelated worktree changes out of commits.

## Handoff

Stop when the archive batch is grounded. The next move is
`geopolitical-synthesis`.

## Compatibility

`best-intake` remains a compatibility alias for this skill during migration.
Existing prompts and `scripts/land_best_intake.py` remain supported.
