# Forecast / Review Hooks

Date: `YYYY-MM-DD`

Status: `template`

Forecast rule: state a causal wager, not topic plus outcome. See [labels as analytical interfaces](../method/analytical-interfaces.md).

## Probability Bands

Use coarse bands, not false precision:

- `low`: roughly 10-30%
- `plausible`: roughly 30-45%
- `likely`: roughly 55-70%
- `high`: roughly 70-85%

## Hooks

| Hook ID | Observable claim | Causal mechanism | Probability Band | Review Date | Strengthening evidence | Weakening evidence | Resolution criteria | Principal alternative | Operational Dependency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `NG-YYYYMMDD-F01` |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | `none` |

## Forecast Quality Gate

- The claim is observable inside the time boundary.
- The mechanism explains why this outcome should occur.
- The principal alternative could explain the same surface evidence.
- Weakening evidence can reduce confidence before resolution.
- Resolution criteria permit `hit`, `miss`, `mixed`, or `unresolvable_with_authorized_evidence` without hindsight rewriting.
- Operational dependency cites one `OPC-*` claim from the day's synthesis or `none`.

## Ledger Entries

Copy final hooks to `work/forecasts/forecast-ledger.md`.

An accountable resolution of `hit`, `miss`, `mixed`, or `unresolvable_with_authorized_evidence` must cite a completed `VER-*` packet in its ledger review note.
