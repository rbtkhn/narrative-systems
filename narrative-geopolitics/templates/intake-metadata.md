# Intake Metadata Sidecar

Use this template to pre-structure an operator-pasted source before running
`best-intake`.

For `host_slug: mario-nawfal`, `trim_opening: auto` now trims both:

- known opening smalltalk/preamble before the substantive interview starts
- known closing scheduling/signoff chatter after the substantive interview ends

Goal:

- minimize re-reading
- minimize routing hesitation
- give `land_best_intake.py` the smallest workable metadata set

The helper now writes trim metrics into landed source frontmatter automatically:

- `opening_trim_chars_saved`
- `opening_trim_words_saved`
- `opening_trim_rule`
- `closing_trim_chars_saved`
- `closing_trim_words_saved`
- `closing_trim_rule`

## How To Use

1. Paste the source body into a local text file.
2. Copy this template into a sidecar note next to it.
3. Fill only the fields you know.
4. Leave uncertain optional fields blank.
5. Run `scripts/land_best_intake.py` from the metadata plus body file.

For batch work, save one filled sidecar per source in a folder and run:

```powershell
.\scripts\python.ps1 scripts\land_best_intake.py --batch-dir C:\path\to\intake-batch
```

## Paste-First Minimum

Same-day one-off intake needs:

- `pub_date` or `ingest_date`;
- `url`;
- source body through `--body-file` or `--body-text`.

Title, voice, host, and source form are inferred when the body is clear. A
single clarification is allowed when host or primary voice ownership is truly
ambiguous.

## Batch Sidecar Fields

For repeatable batch work, provide:

```text
pub_date:
ingest_date:
url:
body_file:
```

Supply these overrides only when known or inference is ambiguous:

```text
title:
voice_slug:
```

## Optional Fields

```text

host:
guest:
show_title:
channel_name:

## Fast-Fill Example

```text
pub_date: 2026-07-07
ingest_date: 2026-07-08
title: Robert Barnes: U.S. Just REVOKED Iran Waivers - We Heading to War
url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0UPyniTc_Q
body_file: C:\temp\2026-07-07-barnes.txt
voice_slug: barnes

host_slug: dialogue-works
host: Nima Alkhorshid
guest: Robert Barnes
show_title: Dialogue Works
channel_name: Dialogue Works
show: Dialogue Works
thread: barnes

kind: cleaned-transcript
source_form: interview
source_class: guest interview pressure test
modality: cleaned-transcript
review_state: unreviewed
routing_state: provisional
trim_opening: auto

source_note: Operator-pasted YouTube transcript from local attachment. Best-intake landing with preserved transcript body.
editorial_note: Preserve as raw cleaned transcript. Not human-verified verbatim.

host_people: Nima Alkhorshid
guest_people: Robert Barnes
```

## Conversion Hint

Turn the sidecar into a helper command by mapping fields directly:

```powershell
.\scripts\python.ps1 scripts\land_best_intake.py `
  --pub-date 2026-07-07 `
  --ingest-date 2026-07-08 `
  --title "Robert Barnes: U.S. Just REVOKED Iran Waivers - We Heading to War" `
  --url "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0UPyniTc_Q" `
  --body-file "C:\temp\2026-07-07-barnes.txt" `
  --voice-slug barnes `
  --host-slug dialogue-works `
  --host "Nima Alkhorshid" `
  --guest "Robert Barnes" `
  --show-title "Dialogue Works" `
  --channel-name "Dialogue Works" `
  --show "Dialogue Works" `
  --thread barnes `
  --host-people "Nima Alkhorshid" `
  --guest-people "Robert Barnes"
```

Or land directly from the sidecar:

```powershell
.\scripts\python.ps1 scripts\land_best_intake.py `
  --metadata-file "C:\temp\2026-07-07-barnes-metadata.txt"
```

## Trim Rule

For `mario-nawfal` interviews, `trim_opening: auto` will try to remove
front-loaded camera check / rapport chatter before the substantive setup begins.

Current behavior:

- only applies automatically when `host_slug: mario-nawfal`
- only trims when a known substantive handoff marker is found at the opening
- also trims known Mario scheduling / next-guest chatter after the guest sign-off
- otherwise leaves the body untouched

Use:

- `trim_opening: auto` for normal behavior
- `trim_opening: none` to preserve the full raw preamble
- `trim_opening: mario-nawfal` to force the Mario-specific trim rule

## Rule

If a field is uncertain and non-required, leave it blank and continue.

Do not delay landing just to make the sidecar look complete.
