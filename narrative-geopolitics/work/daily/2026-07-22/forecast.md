# Forecast / Review Hooks

Date: `2026-07-22`

Status: `live-intake-first`

Forecast rule: state a causal wager, not topic plus outcome. See [labels as analytical interfaces](../method/analytical-interfaces.md).

## Probability Bands

Use coarse bands, not false precision:

- `low`: roughly 10-30%
- `plausible`: roughly 30-45%
- `likely`: roughly 55-70%
- `high`: roughly 70-85%

## Due Review Hooks

Open forecast hooks whose review date is due on or before this run date:

| Hook ID | Original Date | Crisis Object | Claim | Probability Band | Review Date | Source Run |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `NG-20260708-F01` | `2026-07-08` | Hormuz transit governance breakdown | Within 14 days, major public handling of the Iran file will still treat Hormuz as a governed bargaining lane rather than a fully restored free-passage baseline. | `likely` | `2026-07-22` | [2026-07-08](../2026-07-08/forecast.md) |

## Hooks

| Hook ID | Observable claim | Causal mechanism | Probability Band | Review Date | Strengthening evidence | Weakening evidence | Resolution criteria | Principal alternative | Operational Dependency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `NG-20260722-F01` | Within 14 days, at least one public U.S., Iranian, Saudi, or Yemeni posture change will explicitly link maritime access to infrastructure protection, alliance participation, or security guarantees. | Pressure transfers between carriers, forcing actors to state whether access, infrastructure, and partner defense are one bargaining system. | `likely` | `2026-08-05` | A narrow maritime-security frame returns and actors compartmentalize the files. | New statements or implementation actions explicitly join two or more carriers. | Public posture language or implementation connecting maritime access with infrastructure, alliance, or security guarantees. | Actors maintain separate files without a visible linkage. | `none` |

## Forecast Quality Gate

- The claim is observable inside the time boundary.
- The mechanism explains why this outcome should occur.
- The principal alternative could explain the same surface evidence.
- Weakening evidence can reduce confidence before resolution.
- Resolution criteria permit `hit`, `miss`, `mixed`, or `unresolvable_with_authorized_evidence` without hindsight rewriting.
- Operational dependency cites one `OPC-*` claim from the day's synthesis or `none`.

## Ledger Entries

Copy final hooks to `work/forecasts/forecast-ledger.md`.

An accountable resolution of `hit`, `miss`, `mixed`, or `unresolvable_with_authorized_evidence` must cite a completed `VER-*` packet in its ledger review note.
