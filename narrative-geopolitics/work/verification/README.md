# From Claims to Consequences: Operational Verification

Status: `active work contract`

Operational verification tests a selected claim against bounded external evidence. It does not turn repeated commentary into fact, replace archive provenance, or authorize generalized collection.

This packet interface remains canonical for unmigrated historical claims and a
compatibility surface for migrated claims. New adjudication state lives in the
[Reality Verification Lattice](../reality/README.md). Existing `VER-*` IDs and
the assessed July 10 packet are preserved.

## Boundary

- Requests are created explicitly for load-bearing claims.
- Research is limited to the packet's named observables.
- Evidence remains under `work/verification/`; it is not archive source truth.
- Store citations, short compliant excerpts or paraphrases, provenance, and assessment notes—not copied webpages.
- Several URLs derived from one originating report remain one evidence chain.
- The source registry records capability and situated perspective, never a universal trust score.
- Perspective diversity improves access and contradiction detection; observable evidence still governs the assessment.
- Automation validates packet completeness; a human owns the assessment.
- For migrated positive empirical claims, multilingual lattice gates also
  require two languages and chains for ordinary claims or three for
  high-consequence claims.

## Workflow

```text
source_assertion
-> explicit VER request
-> bounded evidence records
-> independence analysis
-> human assessment
-> optional judgment, promotion, publication, or forecast review
```

Commands:

```powershell
.\scripts\python.ps1 scripts\verification.py new --date YYYY-MM-DD --slug TEXT
.\scripts\python.ps1 scripts\verification.py list --json
.\scripts\python.ps1 scripts\verification.py check [VER-ID] --json
.\scripts\python.ps1 scripts\verification.py close VER-ID
.\scripts\python.ps1 scripts\verification.py sources --domain maritime_incident --json
.\scripts\python.ps1 scripts\cadence.py startup operational-verification --packet VER-ID --json
```

The startup preflight is read-only. It binds a session to one existing packet,
reports its live state and validation boundary, and does not browse or create a
request. Packet creation remains the explicit `verification.py new` action.

## Source Registry and Coverage

[`source-registry.md`](source-registry.md) contains 36 manually reviewed sources with stable `VSRC-*` IDs. Each evidence row cites one ID and retains its own URL, event time, originating chain, and translation provenance. Paid sources have open fallbacks. State-affiliated and interested official sources are retained for official positions, warning language, local leads, and contradiction checks; they cannot independently establish an operational fact.

An assessed packet audits six coverage floors. Missing categories are honest waivers, not silent omissions. Two outlets inheriting one report still count as one chain, regardless of political or cultural difference.

## States and Outcomes

Workflow states: `requested`, `researching`, `assessed`, `closed`.

Assessment outcomes: `operationally_supported`, `operationally_contested`, `disconfirmed`, `unresolvable_with_authorized_evidence`, `not_investigated`.

`operationally_supported` means the packet contains affirmative operational evidence adequate for the bounded claim. It never means omniscient or final truth.

## Judgment Gate

Attributed narrative claims may remain `source_assertion` without a packet. A document adopting an operational claim uses:

```markdown
Operational status: `operationally_supported`
Verification packet: VER-YYYYMMDD-NN plus its resolving relative Markdown link
```

Watch promotion and publication templates must use the same gate when a concrete event carries the decision. Accountable forecast resolutions cite a completed `VER-*` packet in the ledger review note.

Before forecast review, use:

```powershell
.\scripts\python.ps1 scripts\cadence.py startup forecast-review --hook NG-YYYYMMDD-FNN --as-of YYYY-MM-DD --json
```

The preflight discovers completed packets both from ledger citations and from
packets that name the hook. Discovery supplies admissible evidence for human
review; it never converts a packet outcome into a forecast score.
